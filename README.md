# TopFactorsForHousePrice

In this project, we would be working on the open dataset of Ames, Iowa.

While price prediction is important, we think that real estate investor’s could achieve better risk adjusted returns focusing on value creation within the properties, leveraging a price prediction models’ key variables driving price. 
If the price and market timing isn’t perfect, being able to inherently add value before sale with confidence in the value creation’s effect will allow an investor of any scale to optimize their capital investments and hopefully achieve a better risk adjusted return. 

As part of this analysis, we will perform the following:
Come up with the ML Model which would predict the house price
Along, with this we will identify the key features which would help the Seller or Real Estate Agent to increase the value of a house by making improvements to particlar section of property. If we mention that the price of property would increase, if the overall quality is excellent, then it would be very broad scoped. If the seller wants to spend $50,000 on home improvement to get a better selling price, then which are the areas that he should concentrate upon to have a better chance of increasing the selling price. Ex: Should the seller add a fireplace, or add new appliances to kitchen etc. We will let the model give us the feature list which would provide data to seller for making informed decisions prior to selling the property.

Even though these features cannot be used to make the decision for properties in other cities like NY or SFO, the principle used in this modeling can be run across the data sets of their respective cities to come up with the Top Factors contributing to House Price.
